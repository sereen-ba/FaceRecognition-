Face Detection in Python using OpenCV



First we need to install opencv but make sure you have the latest python version 
 we can install it using pip type this command in to the terminal app : 'pip install opencv-python'    and for python3 use 'pip install opencv-python'
 
 Face detection using "Haar cascades" is a machine learning based approach where a "cascade" function is trained with a set of input data.
 OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.. 
 
 This code will be using the face classifier and eyes as well...
